### Prediction of burned area of forest fire using KNN-regression.

Authors: Amy Kong, Jaskaran Singh, Sam Zhang

## Summary

  A wildfire is an uncontrolled fire that starts in the wildland vegetation and spreads quickly through the landscape. A natural occurrence, such as a lightning strike, or a human-made spark can initiate a wildfire and wipe away millions of properties, crops, animals and human. However, the extent to which a wildfire spreads is frequently determined by weather conditions. Wind, heat, and a lack of rain may dry out trees, bushes, fallen leaves, and limbs, making them excellent fuel for a fire. 
  
  In this project, **we wish to predict the burned area of forests based on several environmental factors with a KNN-regression model**. By establishing a transparent link between them, it is possible to identify potential risk factors and take appropriate safeguards to prevent the emergence of forest fires and the disasters they generate.
