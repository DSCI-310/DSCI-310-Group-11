# Predicting Burned Area of Forest Fires Using k-NN Regression

Authors: Amy Kong, Jaskaran Singh, Sam Zhang

## Summary

A wildfire is an uncontrolled fire that starts in the wildland vegetation and spreads quickly through the landscape. A natural occurrence, such as a lightning strike, or a human-made spark can easily initiate a wildfire and wipe away millions of properties. However, the extent to which a wildfire spreads is frequently determined by weather conditions. Wind, heat, and a lack of rain may dry out trees, bushes, fallen leaves, and limbs, making them excellent fuel for a fire. In this project, **we wish to predict the burned area of forests based on several environmental factors with a k-NN regression model**. By establishing a transparent link between them, it is possible to identify potential risk factors and take appropriate safeguards to prevent the emergence of forest fires and the disasters they generate.
