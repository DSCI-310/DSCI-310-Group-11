  abstract = {An optimized data-matching machine learning algorithm is developed to provide high-prediction accuracy of total burned areas for specific wildfire incidents. It is applied to a well-studied forest-fire dataset from Portugal Montesinho Natural Park considering 13 input variables. The total burned area distribution of the 517 burn events in that dataset is highly positively skewed. The model is transparent and avoids regressions and hidden layers. This increases its detailed data mining capabilities. It matches the highest burned-area prediction accuracy achieved for this dataset with a wide range of traditional machine learning algorithms. The two-stage prediction process provides informative feature selection that establishes the relative influences of the input variables on burned-area predictions. Optimizing with mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) as separate objective functions provides complementary information with which to data mine each total burned-area incident. Such insight offers potential agricultural, ecological, environmental and forestry benefits by improving the understanding of the key influences associated with each burn event. Data mining the differential trends of cumulative absolute error and squared error also provides detailed insight with which to determine the suitability of each optimized solution to accurately predict burned-areas events of specific types. Such prediction accuracy and insight leads to confidence in how each prediction is derived. It provides knowledge to make appropriate responses and mitigate specific burn incidents, as they occur. Such informed responses should lead to short-term and long-term multi-faceted benefits by helping to prevent certain types of burn incidents being repeated or spread.}

  abstract = {Firebrands are a significant source leading to structures ignited and lost in large outdoor fires, such as Wildland–Urban Interface (WUI) fires, a large international problem, and urban fires, common in Japan. Sadly, hardly any information is available with regard to firebrand production from burning structures or actual large outdoor fires in general. To this end, an experimental database is being generated from firebrand generation from structure combustion. This paper will focus on how these detailed database results are being used to generate firebrand showers using a redesigned firebrand generator experimental apparatus installed in a full-scale wind tunnel, with the intent to experimentally simulate firebrand showers produced from structure combustion in large outdoor fires.}

  abstract = {Firebrand shower and its subsequent spot fires are responsible for more than half of the ignitions reported during wildfires, in particular at wildland urban interface (WUI) areas. The firebrand transport is a highly stochastic and nonlinear problem which directly influences the spotting distribution. Hence, a coupled stochastic model of firebrand showers, that is thoroughly and systematically validated against large scale wind tunnel experiments of lofting and downwind transport of model firebrands, is presented. It is shown that the developed model predicts the first and second order statistics of the flight accurately in relation to the experimental data. The sensitivity of the model to the initial conditions of the flight as well as the velocity field characteristics are examined.}

  abstract={During wildland fires, firebrands form once they break off of burning vegetation or structures. Many are then lofted into the fire plume where they are transported long distances ahead of the fire front, igniting new “spot” fires as they land. To date, very few studies have been conducted on the breakage mechanism of thermally-degraded vegetative elements. Knowledge of these mechanisms is needed to feed mathematical models of firebrand transport from traditional wildfires as well as those that spread into communities. First, a framework to understand the behavior of thermally-degraded wooden elements under simultaneous external loading is presented. A set of experiments were designed such that cylindrical wooden dowels of different species are exposed to different heating conditions similar to wildland fires, in order to model the breakage mechanisms of these elements in the absence of wind. The thermally-degraded elements are subjected to the three-point bending test to obtain the mechanical response of the materials after combustion. Assuming Hookean Orthotropic behavior for combusted dowels, dimensional analysis of the results reveals that the ultimate strength of the dowels is affected by the recoverable elastic strain during loading, which is found to occur under two distinct regimes. These results are not only important for better understanding of the breakage mechanisms but also are advantageous for developing a failure theory of thermally degrading wooden elements under simultaneous wind loading conditions.}

  abstract = {Generation of firebrands from various fuels has been well-studied in the past decade. Limited details have been released about the methodology for characterizing firebrands such as the proper sample size and the measurement process. This study focuses on (1) finding the minimum required sample size to represents the characteristics of the population, and (2) proposes a framework to facilitate the tedious measurement process. To achieve these goals, several firebrand generation tests were conducted at a boundary layer wind tunnel with realistic gusty wind traces. Firebrands were generated from burning structural fuels and collected in 46 strategically located water pans. The statistical analysis showed that the minimum required sample size based on the chosen statistical parameters (standard deviation, confidence interval, and margin of error) is 1,400 for each test. To facilitate characterizing such a large sample of firebrands, an automated image processing algorithm to measure the projected area of the firebrands was developed, which can automatically detect the edges of the background sheet, rotate the photo if its tilted before cropping, detect edges of firebrands, remove erroneous particles (e.g., ash) and finally measures the projected area. To facilitate the weighing process, a Gaussian process regression was performed to predict the mass based on projected area, traveling distance and wind speed. The model can predict the firebrand mass within 5% error compared to the measurement. This framework and model can provide a probabilistic range of firebrand characteristics over the continuous range of the collection region.}
